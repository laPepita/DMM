> Fostering genuine relationships is why we exist.

We think there is value in watching genuine people put themselves out there.  In an age where dating is digital, we want to provide an authentic, in-person experience for friend groups and social circles to interact and come together in the name of finding love.

We aim to create a relaxed and natural atmosphere that provides lighthearted comedy and meaningful introductions.
